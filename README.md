# HotProspects
Project 16 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app utilises many of the techniques used in previous projects whilst incorporating some new skills like QR codes, local notifications and context menus.
The app is designed for use at a conference where the user would have their own QR code based on their name and email. 
The app allows them to see, share and edit their own QR code, aswell as scan others at the conference. This then saves that persons name and email to a list and lets the user mark whether they have been contacted or not.
